Algorithmic Katas
=================

The algorithmic katas is something we're trying where I work. It's using code to solve set problems.
They are designed to practice and improve problem solving skills, which is the core of what
engineers do! 

These are distinct from the code katas we also do, where the emphasis is on design etc. or
working with artificial constraints.  Here it's just about solving the issue, but hopefully 
in an elegant and well designed way at the same time.
